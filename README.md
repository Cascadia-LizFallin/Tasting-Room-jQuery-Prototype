Tasting Room Mobile App Prototype

Users: Individual wine collectors

Purpose: Allow individual wine collectors to track their tasting notes, and store them in their CellarTracker accounts. Notes are recording using the WSET (Wine and Spirit Education Trust) methodology.

User Scenario 1: Tasting Wine
The user is at a wine tasting, and would like to record notes. There are a lot of details, and so she would like a guided way to store her information. The information will later be sent to the user’s computer/tablet, via text or Bluetooth.

User Scenario 2: Referencing notes
The user is at home, and wants to review the tasting notes. She downloads her tasting notes, and stores the notes in her CellarTracker account.

Potential future functionality: 
•	Interface directly with a user’s CellarTracker account, to store tasting notes
•	Use CellarTracker’s API for label searches
•	Post tasting notes to social media
